# String with %s variable assigned as 'snow'
print "Its fleece was white as %s." % 'snow'
# String that prints 10 dots with no spaces
print "." * 10 # what'd that do?

# 12 simple strings

# watch that comma at the end. try removing it to see what happens

# Prints the first 6 strings separated with a comma which python
# interprets as a space or a continued print method.
# Without the comma the 2 prints will print on separate lines.
